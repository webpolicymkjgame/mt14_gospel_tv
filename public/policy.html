<h2>SECTION 2: YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

<p>This section ("Your Rights") applies to users that are located in the European Economic Area only.</p>

<p>You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please email us at healthcare-team.</p>

<h3>1.Access</h3>
<p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account and by contacting healthcare-team. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please email us at healthcare-team.</p>

<h3>2.Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., certain survey information) or pursuant to our contract with you , as described in the section "How We Use Your Personal Information". You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party.  If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another's rights (e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).</p>

<h3>3.Correction</h3>
<p>You have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please email us at healthcare-team.</p>

<h3>4.Erasure</h3>
<p>You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please email us at healthcare-team.</p>

<p>You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal information;</li>
    <li>you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your personal information (as described below) whilst we consider your request.</p>

<p>We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.</p>

<h3>5.Restriction of Processing to Storage Only</h3>

<p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another's protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.</p>

<p>You may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate;</li>
    <li>you wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal information but just store it instead;</li>
    <li>you wish to erase the personal information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>

You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature.</p>

<h2>SECTION 3: MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<h3>1.Information security</h3>
<p>We have implemented administrative, physical and technical security measures that are designed to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand though that, despite our efforts, no security can be guaranteed as impenetrable.</p>

<h3>2.Information about children</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or direct or target interest based advertising to anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 16, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 16 may provide any personal information. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 16, please contact us.</p>

<h3>3.Links to Sites and Service Operated by Others</h3>
<p>GOSPEL TV Service may contain links to other sites, applications, and services.

<h3>5.International Transfer</h3>
<p>We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of information and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Policy.</p>

<h3>6.Contact &amp; Complaints</h3>
<p>In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal information, please contact us in the first instance at healthcare-team and we will endeavor to deal with your request as soon as possible. This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with the data protection authority in the country in which you live or work where you think we have infringed data protection laws.</p>
